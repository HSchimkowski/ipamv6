(done) - fix: JS: clearing also clears Field "F0" when network in "70"-"7F" is selcted ... ???
(done) - fix: clear do not work if a single-Cell-Network ($mask+8) is selected!
(done) - JS: call clear function on ESC-key
(done) - hint into matrix if there are "hidden" Networks, that are not visible into the current depth
(done) - expand "hidden" subnets into Tree view if they are not reachable into the current depth
(done) - add naviation links to headline
(done) - on delete: ask how to handle with subnets?
(done) - on delete: also delet subnets if wanted
(done) - add custom networks (free Input of specific network address and mask)
(done) - add Root-Network Form for beginning with a blank database
(done) - open the new network view after adding a new Network
(done) - fix: got some errors after inserting first root-network
(done) - fix: when editing Networks, there is a Problem with the Available Netmasks (ex: edititing /120 networks -> only /106 - /113 is available)
(done) - after edit an network go back to previus page
(done) - check if network is valid and free in "add new network" form
(done) - fix: Navigation does not always show and links to correct networks if there are more than one root network
(done) - workaround: if you clear the network selection by hitting ESC, all cells will be cleared if cell "00" was in the selection. Workaround: reload the page
(done) - implement e color-picker because IE and Safari do not support HTML5 input type "color". Used the color-picker from http://jscolor.com/ instead.

[higher Priority]
- implement the possibility to subnet a /33 network into some /38 Networks if they are in the same 8 bit boundry

[lower priority]
(done) - prove source-code against W3C Validator for HTML and CSS for better browser compatibility
- only allow possible network-Sizes when editing networks (crete a hint with size of possible network-Sizes or something simmilar)
- optimize Database structure
- add Documentation/howto based on concept
- add Documentation about system-requirements
- protect against SQL-Injections
- add Donate-Button :P
- think about license
- publish on http://www.schimkowski.net/IPAMv6/ (or maybe a subdomain like http://ipamv6.schimkowski.net)


[optional]
- implement usersettings
- implemenet export to RIPE
- implement import from RIPE
- add Interface and device functions
- move Interface-Documentation to an seperate window?
- add user-functionality to allow specified users to work only into their own-Subnets and have a read-only view to the complete Subnet-Tree
- add function to search and register next free subnet of a given Network with a given network mask.
